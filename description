GD Graphics (Draw) Library. GD is an open source code library for the dynamic
creation of images by programmers. GD is written in C, and "wrappers" are
available for Perl, PHP and other languages. GD can read and write many
different image formats. GD is commonly used to generate charts, graphics,
thumbnails, and most anything else, on the fly.
